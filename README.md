### Hi there ðŸ‘‹!
I'm a Computer Science student at NC State University interested in low-level systems programming.

I'm currently an intern at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com), where I work on the Network Drivers team.

You can find my kernel patches [here](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&q=dechen%40redhat.com).
